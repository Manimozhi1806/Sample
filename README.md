**Description**

The project involves a relational database structure comprising tables such as "Athletes 2021", "Events", and "Medals", enforcing constraints like check, unique, primary, and foreign keys for data integrity.
A comprehensive analysis of Olympic events including Athletics, Tennis, Shooting, Swimming, and more was conducted.
Medal distribution among countries like China and Japan, with detailed counts and sport categories, was documented. 
Data management was facilitated through MySQL, with results exported to Excel for report generation, leveraging SQL joins for integrating athlete, event, and medal information seamlessly.
